## 0xA2 chess engine ##

0xA2 is a chess engine that uses a0 methods (or lc0) to play chess. but it performs a shallow alpha beta search with a neural network evaluation.
also known by MCαβ (monte carlo alpha beta, see https://www.chessprogramming.org/MC%CE%B1%CE%B2)

# is this like allie chess? #
I dont know. they say its a hybrid search that uses alpha beta search and monte carlo and it uses the lc0 backend. so I make my own backend (for now only with tensorflow with cppflow project but it is slow so maybe Ill use it too); and it doesnt specify if its the mcαβ.
